## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(here)
library(sf)
library(readr)
library(janitor)
library(dplyr)
library(tmap)
```


```{r}
world_map <- st_read(here("E:/CASA005_R/w4/World_Countries_(Generalized)_9029012925078512962.geojson"))%>%
  clean_names()
```

```{r}
gender_index <- read_csv("E:/CASA005_R/w4/HDR23-24_Composite_indices_complete_time_series.csv",
                       locale = locale(encoding = "latin1"),
                       na = "n/a")%>%
  clean_names()
```

```{r}
gender_index_difference <- gender_index %>%
  dplyr::select(country,hdicode,hdi_2010,hdi_2019) %>%
  mutate(inequality_diff = hdi_2019 - hdi_2010)
```

```{r}
# combine
world_map_combined <- left_join(world_map, gender_index_difference, by = "country")
```

```{r}
head(world_map_combined)
```

#difference in inequality between 2010 and 2019

```{r}
tm_shape(world_map_combined) +
  tm_polygons("inequality_diff",
              palette = "-RdBu",   
              style = "pretty",    
              midpoint = 0) +      
  tm_layout(main.title = "Global Gender Inequality Change: 2010-2019", 
            main.title.size = 1)  
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
